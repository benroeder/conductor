# Build System Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated Conductor from deprecated setup.py to modern pyproject.toml build system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created pyproject.toml
- Defined all package metadata (name, version, description, etc.)
- Specified dependencies (configparser)
- Added optional dev dependencies (pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-mock, hypothesis)
- Configured entry points for conduct and player scripts
- Set up tool configurations for pytest and coverage

### 2. Restructured Scripts
- Created `conductor/scripts/` module directory
- Moved scripts from `scripts/` to `conductor/scripts/` as proper Python modules
- Updated scripts to use `main()` function instead of `__main__()`
- Scripts are now installed as proper console entry points

### 3. Removed setup.py
- Deleted setup.py completely (no longer needed)
- Created tests to verify installation works without setup.py
- All installation now handled through pip and pyproject.toml

### 4. Updated Documentation
- README.md: Updated installation instructions to use pip
- INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md: Removed setuptools references, updated for pip
- QUICK_START.md: Simplified installation to just `pip install .`
- SETUP_NOTES.md: Updated to reflect modern installation
- CLAUDE.md: Updated with new development setup using pip
- PICKLE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md: Added build system modernization to completed items

### 5. Testing
- Created comprehensive build system tests
- Verified package builds correctly with pip
- Tested installation in both regular and editable modes
- All existing tests continue to pass

## Benefits

1. **No More Warnings**: Eliminates setuptools deprecation warnings
2. **Simpler Installation**: Just `pip install .` instead of multiple steps
3. **Better Dependency Management**: Dependencies automatically installed
4. **Modern Standards**: Follows current Python packaging best practices
5. **Future Proof**: Ready for Python packaging changes through 2025 and beyond

## Installation Methods

### Regular Installation
```bash
pip install .
```

### Development Installation
```bash
pip install -e .
# Or with dev dependencies:
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Building Wheels
```bash
python -m build
```

## Migration Path for Users

Users upgrading from old setup.py-based installation:

1. Uninstall old version: `pip uninstall conductor`
2. Update repository: `git pull`
3. Install new version: `pip install .`

No configuration changes needed - all user configs remain compatible.
