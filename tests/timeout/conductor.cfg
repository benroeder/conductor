# Coordinator Test File for testing on localhost

# Discussion: Coordinator Test Files list all the workers that the conductor
# will communicate with as well as setting the conductor's global
# configurations data, such as the number of trials etc.

# Conductor's Global Configuration
[Test]
trials: 1

# List of workers
#
# Both workers are really local to this machine as we're only using
# localhost to communicate.  The worker config is used to talk to the
# dut in order to retrieve a trivial piece of information.  The test
# only confirms that communication exists.

# DUT
