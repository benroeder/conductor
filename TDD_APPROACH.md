# Test-Driven Development Approach for Conductor

## TDD Philosophy

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where tests are written before the actual code. The cycle follows:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests passing

## Benefits for Conductor

1. **Better Design**: Writing tests first forces us to think about the API and interfaces
2. **Regression Prevention**: Tests catch breaking changes immediately
3. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of how the code should behave
4. **Confidence**: Refactoring becomes safer with comprehensive test coverage

## Test Strategy for Conductor

### 1. Unit Tests
- Test individual classes and functions in isolation
- Mock external dependencies (sockets, subprocesses)
- Focus on edge cases and error conditions
- Fast execution (milliseconds per test)

### 2. Integration Tests
- Test interaction between components
- Use real sockets but controlled environments
- Test the protocol between conductor and player
- Slower but more realistic

### 3. End-to-End Tests
- Full system tests with real processes
- Similar to the existing localhost test
- Verify complete workflows
- Slowest but most comprehensive

## Priority Order

Based on complexity and critical functionality:

1. **`step.py`** - Command execution logic
2. **`client.py`** - Core orchestration
3. **`phase.py`** - Step sequencing
4. **`retval.py`** - Communication protocol
5. **`config.py`** - Configuration handling

## Testing Tools

- **pytest**: Modern testing framework
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage reporting
- **pytest-mock**: Mocking support
- **unittest.mock**: Python's built-in mocking

## TDD Workflow Example

```python
# 1. Write a failing test
def test_step_parses_simple_command():
    step = Step("echo hello")
    assert step.cmd == ["echo", "hello"]
    assert step.spawn is False
    assert step.timeout is None

# 2. Run test - it fails (RED)
# 3. Implement minimal code to pass
# 4. Run test - it passes (GREEN)
# 5. Refactor if needed
# 6. Add more tests for edge cases
```

## Coverage Goals

- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- 100% coverage for critical paths
- Focus on behavior coverage, not just line coverage
- Test error paths and edge cases

## Best Practices

1. **Test One Thing**: Each test should verify one behavior
2. **Clear Names**: Test names should describe what they test
3. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests clearly
4. **Independent Tests**: Tests shouldn't depend on each other
5. **Fast Tests**: Unit tests should run in milliseconds
6. **Deterministic**: Tests should always produce same results

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Testing Implementation**: Test behavior, not internals
2. **Brittle Tests**: Avoid tests that break with minor changes
3. **Slow Tests**: Keep unit tests fast
4. **Test Interdependence**: Each test should stand alone
5. **Unclear Assertions**: Make failures obvious

## Continuous Integration

- Run all tests on every commit
- Fail builds if tests fail
- Monitor test coverage trends
- Run slower integration tests every time periodically

## Refactoring with TDD

1. Ensure good test coverage exists
2. Make small incremental changes
3. Run tests after each change
4. If tests fail, revert and try smaller steps
5. Use tests to guide design improvements
