# Coverage Analysis for Conductor Project

## Current Coverage Status

Based on test runs, here's the coverage breakdown for each module:

### ‚úÖ 100% Coverage Achieved
- `conductor/__init__.py` - 100%
- `conductor/config.py` - 100% 
- `conductor/phase.py` - 100% (with our tests)
- `conductor/step.py` - 100% (with our tests)

### üî∂ Partial Coverage
- `conductor/client.py` - 85-88% coverage
  - Missing: Some error handling paths
  - Missing: UnboundLocalError fixes in download() and doit()
  
- `conductor/json_protocol.py` - 89-98% coverage (varies by test)
  - Missing: Some error paths in receive_message
  - Missing: set_max_message_size validation
  
- `conductor/retval.py` - 71-79% coverage
  - Missing: JSON serialization error handling
  - Missing: Circular reference handling

### ‚ùå No/Low Coverage
- `conductor/protocol.py` - 0% (old pickle protocol, replaced by JSON)
- `conductor/reporter.py` - 0% (reporting functionality)
- `conductor/run.py` - 0% (simple module)
- `conductor/test.py` - 0% (simple test container)
- `conductor/scripts/conduct.py` - 0% (CLI script)
- `conductor/scripts/player.py` - 0% (CLI script)

## Priority for Additional Coverage

### High Value Targets
1. **client.py** - Core functionality, already at 85%+
2. **json_protocol.py** - Critical security component, already at 89%+
3. **retval.py** - Communication protocol, at 71%

### Lower Priority
- **protocol.py** - Deprecated pickle protocol
- **reporter.py** - Optional reporting feature
- **CLI scripts** - Harder to test, covered by integration tests

## Recommendations

1. Focus on getting `client.py`, `json_protocol.py`, and `retval.py` to 100%
2. The deprecated `protocol.py` could potentially be removed
3. CLI scripts have integration test coverage through test_cli_integration.py
